# shobhit-updates

**shobhit-updates** is my personal platform where I share project and life updates, integrated with Google Calendar for event tracking.  
It also includes a Proof of Work section to document things I do each day.

All of this is social experiment on myself, because I'm a firm believer that no matter how hard I work, things never go right in my life when it comes to career advancing. And this platform is either to prove me wrong or right, but all you will see here is the work that I do to upskill myself. 

Built with Next.js, Supabase, and hosted on Vercel.
